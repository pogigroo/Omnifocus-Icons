Omnifocus-Icons
===============

A set of icons for different perspectives in [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/) that sync with you iPhone and iPad app for consistent navigation in your GTD environment.

Huge credit to [Josh Hughes](http://dribbble.com/deaghean) for the initial icons that I have based my set on. And [Pixicons](http://pixicon.jackietrananh.com), a cheap and fantastic icon pack that I've used for the different icons.

Feel free to use, share and modify the icons to your own needs, and have fun getting things done.
